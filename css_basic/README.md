# ALX HTML & CSS Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of my ALX Front-End Development learning path. It demonstrates a responsive webpage layout using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on **CSS Flexbox** for positioning and proportional content distribution.

The page includes:

- **Header** with navigation links
- **Main content area** split into:
  - `<article>`: Contains information about the learner, project description, and a table of learners.
  - `<aside>`: Placeholder for comments or additional content
- **Footer** with author information and GitHub link

The layout is designed so that:

- The `<body>` stacks header, main, and footer vertically
- The `<main>` contains a horizontal layout with `<article>` taking 2/3 of width and `<aside>` taking 1/3
- Both `<article>` and `<aside>` allow vertical scrolling if content overflows
- Flexbox is used for responsive and modern layout control
