                <h3>Hello everyone</h3>
                <p>I'm currently learning front-end development through ALX, where I'm building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                   The program emphasizes hands-on practice, real-world projects, and clean, accessible design.
                    It's helping me grow into a confident, job-ready front-end developer with a strong portfolio.</p>
